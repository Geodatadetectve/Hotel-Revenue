# Hotel-Revenue
This dataset will allow you to analyze hotel data revenue.
Aims: To answer the following business queries
•	Is our hotel revenue growing by year? (We have two hotel types so it would be good to segment revenue by hotel type)
•	What trends can we see in the data? (Focus on average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality)
•	Should we increase our parking lot size? (We want to understand if there is a trend in guest with personal cars)

Scope of the analysis is:
1.	Build a Database 
2.	Analyze and Retrieve Data with SQL 
3.	Develop a SQL Query
4.	Connect Power BI to a Database
5.	Visualize Data in Power BI
6.	Summarize findings

Skills used
SQL, Data manipulation, Data merging, data aggregation, Data cleaning, DAX, Data visualization

Tools: Microsoft SQL Server Studio, Excel, MPBI.

Insights
1.	The two hotel chains collectively generated $37.77 million in revenue, with an average daily rate (ADR) of $106.37, based on 1.33 million hotel night bookings. During this period, a special discount of approximately 26% was offered.

2.	From January 1, 2018, to September 14, 2020, there was a gradual increase in revenue for the City Hotel (162.09%) and the Resort Hotel (97.78%). The Resort Hotel saw a surge in revenue on August 17, 2020, reaching a high of $54,460. However, there was a significant decline in revenue for the City Hotel on March 30, 2020, falling by 78.92% ($21,424) in just 161 days.

3.	The City Hotel generated higher total revenue ($20,621,096) than the Resort Hotel ($17,150,012), accounting for 54.59% of the total revenue.

4.	The percentage of parking used from 2018 to 2020 was 30,100. Specifically, the percentage of parking used in 2018, 2019, and 2020 were 2.49%, 2.05%, and 2.34%, respectively. Therefore, there is no need to increase the parking arrangements, especially since only 2.27% of the available parking lot was used during this period.
